### Visualization Control Panel
This panel allows changing various visualization options that will impact the figures shown on the right panel. These options are:
* Choosing the data source (Section **Data sources**)
* Setting the output measures to display (Section **Data data outputs**)
* Displaying the results of a time series analysis and forecast (Section **Time series model**), precisely showing the model fits and forecast, uncertainty bounds and definig the date until when the model should be trained.

In addition, the **Download data** button at the bottom of the panel saves the displayed data and the time series model outputs to a .csv file.
